                <p>DUUUUDE WHAT THE HECK!!! Time has flown by so fast with you. Can't believe we've already been together for 7 months!! Literally every moment 
                with you passes by so quickly, both through the good and bad times. That's insane to me. I'm so lucky to have met you...the other half of me,
                the half the I was missing, finally complete :D We've already been through so much in these past 7M. From first meeting each other, to basketball, to 
                J.Cole/Drake, to getting your own dog, and meeting up in a completely different state. There's obviously a lot of other moments I'm still missing, but 
                if I were to actually list them out this would be one meaty paragraph. I'm excited to see what's next in these next couple of chapters 
                of our lives. I don't know what to expect, the only thing I know for sure is that I want you to be a part of it and continue growing togehter. 
                I'll always be there for you no matter what and I can't wait to help you chase your dreams and reach the goals you want. Anyways though I was 
                put this on a postcard but I didn't have one and I know this wouldn't fit on a little card so from now on expect this. I'll made different links
                for every month so you'll be able to look back at the other ones if you want to :) Anyways though HAPPY 7M BABYYYY!! You already know, 8 letter, 3 words,
                1 meaning, I love you... I'll see you and Nike soon <3 </p>
                                                                       
                <p> Love,
                Your Bestie AKA Twinkie :)
